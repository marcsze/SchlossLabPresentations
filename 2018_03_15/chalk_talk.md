# NIH K99/R00 Brainstorming

What I would like to do is to have a discussion of reasonable aims to shoot for in the grant application. Although I am looking for reasonable I want to make sure that they are still exciting and are able to push the boundaries of our existing knowledge.

### Overarching Goal

The identification and study of the bacteria that are protective against colorectal tumors within the gastrointestinal tract.
