# NIH K99/R00 Brainstorming
## Marc Sze

What I would like to do is to have a discussion of reasonable aims to shoot for in the grant application. Although I am looking for reasonable I want to make sure that they are still exciting and are able to push the boundaries of our existing knowledge.

### Main Goal

The identification and study of the bacteria that are protective against colorectal tumors within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Overarching Hypothesis

Members of the gastrointestinal microbiota provide protection against colorectal tumors via specific released metabolites that act to inhibit growth.

### K99 Aims:

1. Identify bacteria within the community that are associated with lower tumor burdens.

	* use variations in polyp burden in those with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) 
		* identify candidate bacteria that may be protective against tumorigenesis 
			* correlating these microbes to low polyp burden
		* primarily 16S rRNA gene sequencing 

	* use two approaches 
		* targeted
			* use work already done to identify potential candidate genera in our meta-analysis
		* untargeted
			* will make no prior assumptions or data.   

2. Identify key bacterial genes that are correlated with lower tumor burdens.

	* Using microbes identified from both approaches in aim 1, focus on the specific contigs that fall within these taxa to identify the specific species and genes from these respective microbes that associate with low polyp burden. 

	* Potentially confirm with existing independent cohorts


### R00 Aims:

3. Analyze the metabolome for compounds that are associated with low tumor burden.

	* Three goals 
		* Probe for metabolites associated with people with low polyp burden. 
		* Generate an overall metabolite profile that can be used to identify key metabolites in aim 4. 
		* Integrate the 16S, metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metabolome together to narrow potential candidate pathways and products.


4. Assess whether filtered stool supernatant has anti-tumorigenic activity on tumor cell lines

	* Use cancer assays derived from GI cancer cell lines, 
		* introduce filtered stool supernatant 
			* assess whether a reduction in cell growth can be detected 
			* use data generated from any or all of aim 1,2, and 3
				* link these with the activity profiles of the supernatant 
					* narrow down the most active and promising compounds.
