# Keystone Summary
## Banff, Alberta
### March 4-8, 2018

### Check out the future conference

First, a quick plug for the next microbiota meeting that Keystone is hosting:

[Microbiome: Chemical Mechanisms and Biological Consequences](http://www.keystonesymposia.org/index.cfm?e=web.Meeting.Program&meetingid=1609)

It is held from March 10-19, 2019 and it will be in Montreal, Quebec.


### Overview

There were two concurrent sessions that took place 
 * Manipulation of the Gut Microbiota for Metabolic Health (X3)
 * Microbiome, Host Resistance and Disease (X4)

Once you registered to either of these tracks you could attend either as you wanted throughout March 4-8 and there were also joint sessions for both tracks.

### Day 1

I thought the keynote was one of the more fascinating talks of the conference. Andreas Baumler did a really good job of telling a story of the importance of the host in host-microbiome interactions in infection and IBD. The short version is that the epithelial lining metabolises SCFAs (specifically butyrate) and in so doing uses oxygen. By using the oxygen these host cells create a anaerobic environment that excludes facultative anaerobes (the bad guys). The main reason the facultative anaerobes start to overgrow and become dominant in disease states is because of the destruction of the host epitenlium. He is slowly trying to show that this is a universal process that occurs in all diseases that involve the colon. It is arguing that the host is a crucial component with microbes more of a bystander but it does it in a really smart methodical way.

Next up was Fredrik Backhed where he examined obesity, T2 Diabetes, and the microbiota. I was really surprised that he cited in his presentation the meta-analysis that Pat and I authored as well as put in a plug about me speaking later in the conference. His overall presentation was very molecular with a lot of western blots. I think the main takeaway that I got from this talk was his statement that, "I'm not interested in obesity per se because you can live a long life while obese but not so with T2 Diabetes."
