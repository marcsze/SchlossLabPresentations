# Overview

This journal club I want to continue to build upon the sort of concept that Amanda started.  We will be reviewing the article for the 
first half but I don't want to dwell too much on the problems with it (which there are a number).  I purposely selected a short article since I want to use the other part of the time  to break into groups and work through the abstract.
