# Overview

This journal club I want to continue to build upon the sort of concept that Amanda started.  We will be reviewing the article for the 
first half but I don't want to dwell too much on the problems with it (which there are a number).  I purposely choose a short article since I want to use the 
the other part of the time I want to use to break into groups and work through the abstract.  Picking things that might help it now that
you know what the paper is about.
