## R for Data Science Lab Meeting Materials
### Chapters 9-11

In general this lesson involves looking at how to handle data structures within the `tidyverse` ecosystem. This is not the only way to manage your data from graphical purposes but it is a nice integrated environment that provides many tools that you can customize for your own use to make managing and transforming data easier and more manageable.

**The main components of "Wrangling" your data are as follows:**

For this session we are going to split into teams to tackle a select number of questions for chapters 10 and 11. The teams for this session are going to be:

Team 1: Nick and Ada  
Team 2: Kaitlin and Pat  
Team 3: Filipe and Will  

Charlie can choose which team he would like to join. There will not be a lot of coding per se. Instead we will focus on more higher level concepts and then come together to discuss each of the questions.

*The breakdown will be as follows:*  
* 30 minutes to work through the questions  
* 20 minutes to discuss the questions  
* 10 minutes for general questions on chapters 9-11  





**Other types of data:**

* `.xls` or `.xlsx` can use special packages such as readxl
  * I've had a bad experience with these and now store everything default as `.csv`
  
* SQL databases can be queried using the DBI package
  * Many complicated data structures are stored in this way (e.g. Relational Databases)

* Can always refer to the end of [Chapter 11](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) for other programs that read specialized data types into R
