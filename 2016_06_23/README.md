# Schloss Lab Graphing Hack-a-thon
## Use ggplot2 or base


**General Overview**

We are going to try something new and build off of Kaitlin's excellent presentation last week.
  
The lab will be split into teams of two listed below and will be assigned to use either ggplot2 or base to create the graph shown. 
The usage of either base or ggplot2 will also be preassigned and what each team is to use will be provided below.  
The first 30 mins will be dedicated to creating a graph in your teams, the next 20 mins will be left open to view the graphs 
and comment on what everyone on the team liked and did not like about making the graph with either base or ggplot2, the last 10 mins will 
be dedicated to open discussion of the graphs and what you liked about everyones graph or what could be universally problematic with 
base or ggplot2 for this particular graph.


**Teams**

Matt J and Matt D - Base  
Geoff and Kaitlin - ggplot2  
Pat and Charlie - Base  
Nick and Marian - ggplot2
