# Schloss Lab Graphing Hack-a-thon
## Use ggplot2 or base


**General Overview**

We are going to try something new and build off of Kaitlin's excellent presentation last week.
    
The lab will be split into teams of two listed below and will be assigned to use either ggplot2 or base to create **their own** version of the graph in the `.pdf` file found within this repo.  All the data that you will need can be found in the `.csv` file titled *test3R.csv*.  Simply clone the repository and follow the below instructions and you will be on your way:
  
*   Copy the repo  ```git clone https://github.com/marcsze/SchlossLabPresentations.git```
*   Move into the `2016_06_23` directory of `SchlossLabPresentations`
*   Move these files to whatever directory you want them in
*   Work with your team to create a kick-!@# graph

Now, if this command does not work there will be a USB provided during the session so that you will be able to get the data without any hassale or significant loss of time to make the graph.
  
The usage of either base or ggplot2 will also be preassigned and what each team is to use will be provided below.  If teams want to see the actual code used to build the graph in the  `.pdf` file they can take a look at the `.R` file also provided with this repo.  
  
There will be a 5-10 mins intro on my graph version and the data table so that everyone is on the same page with respects to what the data is trying to represent.  The next 20-30 mins will be dedicated to creating a graph in your teams, the next 20 mins will be left open to view the graphs and comment on what everyone on the team liked and did not like about making the graph with either base or ggplot2, the last 10-20 mins will be dedicated to open discussion of the graphs and what you liked about everyones graph or what could be universally problematic with base or ggplot2 for this particular graph.


**Teams**

Matt J and Matt D - *Base*  
Geoff and Kaitlin - *ggplot2*  
Pat and Charlie - *Base*  
Nick and Marian - *ggplot2*
