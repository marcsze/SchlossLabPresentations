## Outline for Code Review

We will run through this code and then together talk about ways in which to improve it or alternative ways by which you would have done things.  To facilitate this after running through the code in one big group we will split up into smaller groups to discuss and then come back together to share new and improved solutions.

**Order of events:**
* Code review as a group
* Breakout into groups
* Discussion on code improvement


*Breakout Groups:*  
1) Geoff and Charlie  
2) Pat and Matt D  
3) Matt J and Kaitlyn  
4) Nick and Marc
