## The Bacterial Microbiome in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

A talk on the general overview and progress thus far on the family microbiome project.  Foucs will be on an overall update on the project.  However, there will be some discussion points that will include whether or not to include metagenomics into the pipeline as well as alternative approaches to analysis versus what was taken in the journal presented last week.
