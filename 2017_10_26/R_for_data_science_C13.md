### Chapter 13

**Introduction**

This chapter goes into more detail into some of the concepts covered within chapters 9-11. Specifically, it deals with how to work with relational data and the tools that the `tidyverse` provides to facilitate this. For this session we will be working exclusively with the `nycflights13` database so make sure you have that installed on your computer. 

What you see below ([click here if image doesn't show up](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)) in the image is an example of the relations that exist between the different data tables and the flights data. What are the advantages with having data stored in this way? Are there any disadvantages?
