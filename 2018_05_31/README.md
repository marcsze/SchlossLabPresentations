# A Data Visualization Bonanza

**Main Objective**  
By the end of this lesson learners should have successfully recreated a specific type of graph using the given data, list three or more strengths and weaknesses of the visualization, and have shared these with the rest of the lab group.

**Needed File**
* otu_table.csv

**Instructions**
* Download the specific `otu_table.csv` file or pull this specific repo.
* Create a graph that highlights differences between case and control groups for 1 OTU.
* Use the `map` function to create 3 identical graphs of 3 different OTUs (**BONUS**)
* The base graph type will be divided amongst the groups 
	* A random draw will be done to determine which group gets to choose their type of graph first

**Base graph option**
* Pie chart
* Points and lines
* Box plot
* Violing plot
* Bar plot

*Note: This forms the base of your graph that will be used to represent each individual within the figure, it does not have to be the only thing in it. Use your knowledge of the tidyverse and ggplot2 to make a kick-ass visual*
