# Code Review of R scripts
## Main concepts of review are more general best practices
### February 22, 2018


I have chosen some code examples from GitHub and this lesson is inspired by conversations that I had with Nick. 

The main goal of this code review is to read through and interpret the example code. Some things that I would like people to think about as we work through these examples are:

1.	What would make the code clearer?
2.	Are there ways to make the code more efficient?
